The project consists of developing an artificial intelligence model that is capable of solving the famous Rubik's cube puzzle automatically. To achieve this, a technique known as Deep Q-Networks (DNQ) is used.
The main idea is to train an artificial intelligence agent using the reinforcement learning technique. The agent is challenged to solve the Rubik's cube and learns to make decisions based on his current state and the actions available to move the faces of the cube. Using the DNQ technique, the agent learns to select the best actions in each state to get closer to an optimal solution.
Model training is done through a combination of exploration and exploitation. The agent explores different movements and actions to discover new strategies and learn from the feedback received. At the same time, the agent also exploits prior knowledge and learned experiences to improve its performance.
During training, the model is faced with different configurations of the Rubik's Cube and is given a positive reward when it progresses towards the solution and a negative reward when it moves away from the solution. As the agent continues to train and adjust his strategy, it is expected that he will be able to solve the Rubik's Cube more efficiently and in fewer moves.
Once the model is trained, it can be used to solve the Rubik's Cube automatically. The agent evaluates the current state of the cube and selects the optimal actions to reach a solution. The final result is a model capable of solving the Rubik's cube autonomously and efficiently.
